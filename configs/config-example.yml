# This is an example configuration file for kube2kafka.
# It covers all the possible configuration options.

# The following fields are not required, but they are shown here for
# demonstration purposes:
# - namespace (default: all namespaces)
# - maxEventAge (default: 1 minute)
# - bufferSize (default: 128)
# - kafka.compression (default: none)
# - kafka.tls (default: no TLS)
# - kafka.sasl (default: no SASL)
# - kafka.sasl.mechanism (default: plain)
# - filters (default: no filter will be applied)
# - selectors (default: all fields will be sent to Kafka)

clusterName: "example.kube2kafka.cluster"  # used to identify the cluster
namespace: "default"
# Max event age is used to filter out events during initial sync (list request).
# This allows to avoid sending all occurred events to Kafka when kube2kafka starts.
maxEventAge: "1m"
# Each of crucial components of kube2kafka (watcher -> processor -> exporter) is connected
# with next one using a ring buffer. The buffer size is used to control the amount of events
# that can be stored in the buffer. In case of high traffic, buffer implementation will allow to
# override the oldest data, thus its size should be adjusted to the expected traffic.
bufferSize: 128
